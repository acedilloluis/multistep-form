## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

This project let me practice using TailwindCSS. I also practiced more with breaking down a project into components.

### Continued development

In future projects I'd like to continue to use TailwindCSS. I also would like to continue to practice breaking down projects into components. In this project I believe I could have written the components in a more readable way.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Toggle Button](https://codepen.io/lhermann/pen/EBGZRZ) - Provided the solution used in this project for a toggle button built using TailwindCSS
